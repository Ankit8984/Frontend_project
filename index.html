                <p>
                    Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling.

                <p>
                    FCFS is the simplest of all the Disk Scheduling Algorithms. In FCFS, the requests are addressed in the order they arrive in the disk queue. Let us understand this with the help of an example.

                        <p>
                            In SCAN algorithm the disk arm moves into a particular direction and services the requests coming in it's path and after reaching the end of the disk. it reverses it's direction and again services the request arriving in it's path. So, this algorithm works as an elevator and hence also known as elevator algorithm. As a result. the requests at the midrange are serviced more and those arriving behind the disk arm will have to wait.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is similar to the SCAN disk scheduling algorithm except for the difference that the disk arm in spite of going to the end of the disk goes only to the last request to be serviced in front of the head and then reverses it's direction from there only. Thus it prevents the extra delay which occurred due to unnecessary traversal to the end of the disk.
